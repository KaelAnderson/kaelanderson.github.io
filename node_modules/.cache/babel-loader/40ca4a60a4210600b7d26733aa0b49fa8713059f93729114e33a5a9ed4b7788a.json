When I encountered an issue with a Python library missing a necessary experimental feature for green route generation, a teammate and I resolved it by making a JSON curl request. In the end, we successfully delivered a working prototype that showcased GreenPath's potential.</div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <img src={GreenPathLogo}  alt=\"\" />\r\n                            </div>\r\n                            <h3>Writing and presenting</h3>\r\n                            <div className=\"proj-rows\">\r\n                                <div>\r\n                                    <div>Putting together the presentation for GreenPath was an important part of our project.

We made sure to highlight how the app helps users choose more eco-friendly routes and track their carbon savings.</div>\r\n                                    <div>When it was time to present, I walked the audience and judges through our project, showing off its key features and demonstrating how it worked. I made sure to prepare for questions from the judges and did a live demo to show the app in action. The feedback we received was really positive, and it felt great to see our hard work recognized.</div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <img src={GreenPathLogo}  alt=\"\" />\r\n                            </div>\r\n                            <h3>Reflecting on the Experience</h3>\r\n                            <div className=\"proj-rows\">\r\n                                <div >Winning 1st place at the KSU Spring 2024 Hackathon was a tremendous validation of our efforts.
